# Netflix Analysis with Python

## Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Analysis project! In this project, I leverage Python to analyze Netflix_titles dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the Netflix platform. We explore questions such as the most popular release year for movies, the year Netflix added the most content, the most popular month to add new content, the movie with the longest title, and the cast that appears most frequently.

## Dataset
The Netflix dataset used for this analysis contains information on titles available on the Netflix platform, including movies and TV shows. The dataset includes attributes such as title, type (movie or TV show), release year, cast, country, and date added to Netflix.

## Analysis Tasks
1. Most Popular Release Year for Movies on Netflix
    - Analysis: Determine the release year with the highest number of movies available on Netflix.
    - Python Code: Analyze the distribution of movie releases by year and identify the most popular release year.
2. Year Netflix Added the Most Content
    - Analysis: Identify the year with the highest number of content additions to Netflix.
    - Python Code: Analyze the distribution of content additions by year and determine the year with the most content.
3. Most Popular Month to Add New Content
    - Analysis: Determine the month with the highest number of new content additions to Netflix.
    - Python Code: Analyze the distribution of content additions by month and identify the most popular month.
4. Movie with the Longest Title
    - Analysis: Find the movie with the longest title available on Netflix.
    - Python Code: Calculate the length of the title for each movie and identify the movie with the longest title.
5. Cast that Appears Most
    - Analysis: Determine the cast member(s) that appear most frequently in Netflix titles.
    - Python Code: Count the occurrences of each cast member and identify the most common cast.

## Repository Structure
- Data: Contains the Netflix dataset used for analysis.
- Scripts: Contains Python scripts for data analysis tasks.
- Results: Contains results and generated from the analysis.
- README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, dataset, analysis tasks, and Python code.

## Conclusion
The Netflix Analysis project provides valuable insights into various aspects of the Netflix platform, including content distribution, release patterns, and popular titles. By leveraging Python for data analysis, we uncover actionable insights to better understand user preferences and optimize content offerings on the Netflix platform.
